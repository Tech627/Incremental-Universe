        <div id="Lore-SC"> Aarex: You are weakling! You can't defeat the almighty Realm Defenders! 
            <br> ???: You may defeated me, but you forgot one thing. I am the real danger here..
            <br> MrRedShark: Back off I know his tricks. Just run! Run He is going to kill both of you!
            <br> Jacorb: No! We can't leave you behind! We are going to fight with you.. 
            <br> MrRedShark: I am sorry. I shouldn't take care of them at first (teleports Jacorb and Aarex).
            <br> ???: So. You are leaving ur teammates here? You are going to die right here. But I have a offer for you.
            <br> Team up with me and I won't kill you. How does that sound?
            <br> MrRedShark: (cancels his attack and giggles) Good offer. But I have a better one.
            <br> ???: What is it?
            <br> MrRedShark: It's too late (Activates his Powerful form). Now You die.
            <br> ???: NOO!
            <br> MrRedShark: This is for the Acamada!
            <br> (As they fought MrRedShark managed to kill ???, and get a powerful artifact. This artifact is crucial
            <br> for killing the Celestials).
            <br> (As MrRedShark was traveling with the artifact all tired. He got met by the Void Lord.)
            <br> MrRedShark: What do you want now.. 
            <br> Void Lord: Just to help you. I want to team up with you.
            <br> MrRedShark: I may be tired but not going to team up with you liar! How can I believe you after what you did 
            <br> to Acamada?
            <br> Void Lord: Trust me I won't..
            <br> MrRedShark: I am not going to team up with you if i DIE!
            <br> Void Lord: Very well.. You wanted it. Voidlings ATTACK!!
            <br> (as MrRedShark fought the Voidlings he was getting more and more tired but he would always kill them).
            <br> Void Lord: Why aren't you dieing! Backrooms Where are you!
            <br> MrRedShark: Now... You... Are going to pay (Gets the Forgiven Mythical sword from nowhere that 
            <br> only the master crafters knew how to build them). 
            <br> (As MrRedShark approached Void Lord. The Backrooms arriaved).
            <br> MrRedShark: oh, no. Not this time (With the sword he makes them dissappear).
            <br> Void Lord: As I see u are strong but you won't catch me alive! (teleports).
            <br> MrRedShark: Not this time. (punches with the sword on the floor and teleports to him).
            <br> Void Lord: Finally i got away.. Seems that they got a lot stronger, but it's okay.
            <br> (MrRedShark was very quiet because he was in the main setlement where the Void Lord's army was he was
            <br> following him).
            <br> Void Lord: I am back!! How's my little girl doing today.
            <br> Acamada: (mummling while having tape on her mouth).
            <br> Void Lord: oh yh that's right you can't talk let me just..
            <br> Acamada: You bastard! You are not going to kill any of the Realm Defenders!
            <br> Void Lord: Or you think so.. You see I am making a really big plan and u are going to play a part of it.
            <br> Acamada: What is the plan?
            <br> Void Lord: You are going to get back home and tell everyone you found my base. And Lure them here!
            <br> MrRedShark: NOT ON MY WATCH. (Throws the sword and stabs him in the heart).
            <br> Void Lord: NOOOOOOO!
            <br> Acamada: MrRedShark! I thought I won't see you anymore!
            <br> MrRedShark: Let me teleport you.
            <br> (teleports Acamada and himself to the Realm Defenders.)
            <br> Aarex and Jacorb: ACAMADA!! (hugs her)
            <br> Acamada: You guys are really in shock.
            <br> Aarex: I thought you were dead.
            <br> Acamada: Well clearly I am not.
            <br> Jacorb: Well atleast you are safe.
            <br> Acamada: Yeah. But I gotta take a break I am tired.
            <br> MrRedShark: We don't have to worry about Void Lord anymore I killed him! 
            <br> Aarex and Jacorb: Nice! We just need to take down the backrooms too!
